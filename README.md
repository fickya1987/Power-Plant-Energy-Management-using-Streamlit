# Power Plant Energy Management using Streamlit
 This is a streamlit webapp used to predict the electrical power output of a Combined Cycle Power Plant
 
 The User Interface for the WebApp is shown below:

# The aim of the project was to use Streamlit Library to build a Web Application, where Machine Learning can be used.

# The Requirements for the project include:
1. Streamlit
2. Pandas
3. Matplotlib
4. Scikit-Learn
5. XGBoost
6. Numpy

Be sure to install the required libraries, for the project to work.

# There are 3 files which need to looked at:
1. The Jupyter Notebook used to train the RandomForest and XGBoost models to train the model on the data
2. The CCP_Management.py file. This file is where the Streamlit UI is built.
3.  The data files: The Data_Regression.csv and PowerPlantData.csv These are available at: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Combined+Cycle+Power+Plant
4.  Finally, the models were saved as Pickle files. One for the XGBoost Regression Model, and one for the Random Forest Regressor.

##### I had a fun working on this project. For more information on how to use StreamLit the documentation is available on: https://docs.streamlit.io/
##### There is also a FreeCodeCamp Tutorial I used to built streamlit apps available at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JwSS70SZdyM&t=587s

##### I hope this is helpful to anyone trying to build useful web application using Python.
